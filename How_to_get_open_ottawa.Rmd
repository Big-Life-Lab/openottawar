What does url_end refer too. For this function url end is the string after "https://open.ottawa.ca/datasets/" for example:
"https://open.ottawa.ca/datasets/hospital-retirement-home-and-group-home-covid19-outbreaks" here url end is: "hospital-retirement-home-and-group-home-covid19-outbreaks"

```{r cars}
library(openottawar)
# This downloads the data from that page and saves it as new_data.xlsx
get_open_ottawa(url_end = "covid-19-hospitalization-data-for-ottawa-residents", file_dest = paste0(getwd(), "/new_data.xlsx"))
```
